                                <p>Chives are the smallest and most delicately flavoured member of the onion family. They have a mild, fresh, onion flavor and bright green color. We have the standard garlic chives, which are best used for simmering foods and sauces. They pair extremely well with seafood and will make every omelette richer in taste and look, since they do not lose the green color.</p>
                                <p>Kenya specializes in growing both types of chives and once you get a hold onto these fresh Kenyan chives that we provide, you can start getting creative in the kitchen. Owing to its position on the equator, Kenya has the perfect conditions for growing chives: a full sun as well as rich and moist soils, plus high annual rainfall.</p>
                                <p>Chives can also be grown on your window sill, but nothing can replace those chives that come from Kenya. Feel free to experiment with Kenya chives and bring aromatic meals from Africa.</p>
                                <p>With us by your side, we are glad to deliver it to your destination on time</p>
